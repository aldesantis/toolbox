# Toolbox

This repository contains a collection of utilities designed to simplify some of my daily tasks, from processing RSS feeds to transforming files using LLMs.

Note that most of these utilities are generated via AI (for the most part, Claude and GitHub Copilot), so the code quality may vary. Still, they get the job done.

This toolbox is a good example of home-cooked software as discussed by Maggie Appleton in [Home-Cooked Software](https://maggieappleton.com/home-cooked-software).
